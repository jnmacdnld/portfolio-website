    The adorable home robot with advanced computer vision & sensor
    fusion
  img: kuri_thumb.jpg

highlights:
- Implemented person tracker using a custom systematic importance resampling particle filter to fuse point clouds from depth sensor with visual bounding boxes from MobileNet object detector  
- Implemented person follower using a PID controller and a feedback linearization approach
- Integrated person following feature into robot with voice command

    tracked_person coordinate frame are particles from the particle filter;
    other points are 3D points from the depth sensor.
